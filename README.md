➛French Teacher App handles mp3 media files. When the user opens the App, a simple UI with 5 buttons appears. 

➛The 5 buttons are named "Black", "Green", "Purple", "Red", "Yellow".

➛When the user clicks on any of these buttons, the corresponding mp3 file plays in the background which is basically a translation of the color mentioned on the button in French.
